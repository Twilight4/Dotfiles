Put it in: /usr/share/fonts (dont forget to configure them in terminal emulator)

In Debian-based systems like Ubuntu and its derivatives, copy the font files to /usr/share/fonts/ or /usr/local/share/fonts/ location to install fonts for all users i.e. system-wide.

If you want to install fonts for a particular user, copy the fonts to ~/.local/share/fonts/ location.
