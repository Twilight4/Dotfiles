  #   - quiet:   Enable instant prompt and don't print warnings when detecting console output
  #              during zsh initialization. Choose this if you've read and understood

  #   - verbose: Enable instant prompt and print a warning when detecting console output during
  #              zsh initialization. Choose this if you've never tried instant prompt, haven't
  #              seen the warning, or if you are unsure what this all means.
