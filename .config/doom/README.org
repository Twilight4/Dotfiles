This documentation provides cheat sheet for which presents keybindings for my emacs configuration which is designed for potentiality to achieve enhanced productivity while minimizing the need for excessive and complex key combinations. The primary objective is to streamline the user experience, by minimizing the need for excessive key combinations and utilizing those that are often overlooked or unutilized by default and at the same time enjoying the same list of keybindings across various keyboard-driven tools such as terminal multiplexers, browsers and text editors.

* Keybinding Philosophy
The keybinding philosophy adopted in this configuration prioritizes simplicity and ease of use. The aim is to minimize the number of key combinations required to perform frequently used actions, thereby reducing cognitive load and improving overall efficiency. This approach makes Emacs more accessible to users familiar with other applications and encourages a smoother transition.
