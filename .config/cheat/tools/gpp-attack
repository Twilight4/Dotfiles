Key flaw of GPP/cPassword Attack:
  GPP allowed admin to create policies using embedded credentials
  These credentials were encrypted and placed in "cPassword".
  The key was accidentally released, patched in MS14-025 but it
  doesn't prevent previous uses.

How to perform If have credentials:
  Metasploit - smb_enum_gpp module

Mitigation:
  Patch - fixed in KB2962486
  Delete the old GPP xml files stored in the SYSVOL
