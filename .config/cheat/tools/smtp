# the command VRFY can be used to enumerate existing users on the system. 
# However, this does not always work. Depending on how the SMTP server 
# is configured, the SMTP server may issue code 252 and confirm the existence 
# of a user that does not exist on the system.

# If we also print out the output of the scan in detail, we will also be able to see which tests the script is running
