SMB Client to access resources on SMB servers

Options:
-N         No password
-U name    Specify the user
-L         This option allows you to look at what services are available on a server

SMB shell commands:
get         Download files
!ls         Local ls
!cat        Local cat
more "name of file"
            Cat out the name of the file in quotations so it can involve spaces

SMB Enumeration:
See if our interesting share has been configured to allow anonymous access,
I.E it doesn't require authentication to view the files. We can do this easily by:
  using the username "Anonymous" (-U Anonymous)
  connecting to the share we found during the enumeration stage
  not supplying a password

Look for .ssh directory once logged in, if you can find id_rsa you can ssh in using this key
and using username found in id_rsa.pub: chmod 600 id_rsa && ssh -i id_rsa <USER>@<IP_ADDRESS>
