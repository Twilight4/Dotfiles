  One of the benefits of HTTPS is encrypting the transmitted data using SSL keys stored on a server.
  If you apply the same technique we showed previously on a web server with SSL enabled, then we can see that all transmitted data will be encrypted.

  [ICMPDoor](https://github.com/krabelize/icmpdoor) is an open-source reverse-shell written in Python3 and scapy. 
  The methodology is the same with the only difference that an attacker sends a command that needs to be executed
  on a victim's machine. Once the command is executed, a victim machine sends the execution output within the `ICMP` packet in the `Data` section.
