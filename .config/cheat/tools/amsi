PowerShell snippets that break or disable AMSI for the current process

Informational:
You can attach this obfuscated PowerShell snippet from amsi.fail at the beginning of your malicious code as with
previous bypasses or run it in the same session before executing malicious code.


AMSITrigger allows attackers to automatically identify strings that are flagging signatures to modify and break them.
This method of bypassing AMSI is more consistent than others because you are making the file itself clean.
