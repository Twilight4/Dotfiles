Microsoft released AMSI (Anti-Malware Scan Interface), a runtime monitoring solution designed to stop and monitor ongoing threats.

Powershell Downgrade
Most PowerShell sessions will start with the most recent PowerShell engine, but attackers can manually change the version with a one-liner.
By "downgrading" the PowerShell version to 2.0, you bypass security features since they were not implemented until version 5.0.
Source: https://github.com/trustedsec/unicorn

The attack only requires a one-liner to execute in our session.
We can launch a new PowerShell process with the flags -Version to specify the version (2):
Usage:
  PowerShell -Version 2

This attack can actively be seen exploited in tools such as `Unicorn`

Informational:
  Since this attack is such low-hanging fruit and simple in technique, there are a plethora of ways for the blue team to detect and mitigate this attack.
  The two easiest mitigations are removing the PowerShell 2.0 engine from the device and denying access to PowerShell 2.0 via application blocklisting.


amsi.fail will compile and generate a PowerShell bypass from a collection of known bypasses, generates obfuscated
PowerShell snippets that break or disable AMSI for the current process
Source: http://amsi.fail/

Informational:
  You can attach this obfuscated PowerShell snippet from amsi.fail at the beginning of your malicious code as with
  previous bypasses or run it in the same session before executing malicious code.


AMSITrigger allows attackers to automatically identify strings that are flagging signatures to modify and break them.
This method of bypassing AMSI is more consistent than others because you are making the file itself clean.
Source: https://github.com/RythmStick/AMSITrigger

Usage:
  AmsiTrigger_x64.exe -i "bypass.ps1" -f 3

Informational:
  Syntax for using amsitrigger is relatively straightforward; you need to specify the file or URL and what format to scan the file
  Signatures are highlighted in red; you can break these signatures by encoding, obfuscating, etc.
