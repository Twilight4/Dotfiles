What is LLMNR:
  Used to identify hosts when DNS failts to do so

Key flaw:
  When intercepting traffic, we can capture username and a hash (NTLMv2) when we respond to the traffic (MiTM attack).

Mitigation:
  Disable LLMNR and NBT-NS, if can't:
    require network access control
    strong user passwords
