nslookup - DNS lookup tool (check fot hosts based on an IP range and for IPs based on hostnames)

A manual approach for testing zonetransfers will be the following set of commands
USE THE TARGET'S IP ADDRESS AS THE NAME SERVER

ZONE TRANSFERS ARE THE ONE WITH ADDRESS: 127.0.0.1
If we manage to perform a successful zone transfer for a domain, there is no need to 
continue enumerating this particular domain as this will extract all the available information.
