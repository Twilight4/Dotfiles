Source: https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat

Usage:
hashcat -a 0 -m 0 f806fc5a2a0d5ba2471600758452799c /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

Commands:
hashcat -h                        List of supported hashes
hashcat --show                    Show the cracked value if the hash has been cracked

Options:
-a 0                              Sets the attack mode to a dictionary attack
-m 0                              Sets the hash mode for cracking MD5 hashes
f806fc5a2a0d5ba2471600758452799c  This option could be a single hash like our example
                                  or a file that contains a hash or multiple hashes
/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt  Wordlist/dictionary file for our attack
-a 3                              Sets the attacking mode as a brute-force attack
?d?d?d?d                          The "?d" tells hashcat to use a digit. In this case, 
                                  "?d?d?d?d" for four digits starting with "0000" and ending at "9999"
--stdout                          Print the result to the terminal
