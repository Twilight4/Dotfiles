Networking:
  ip address show       IP addresses can be shown
  cat /etc/resolv.conf  The DNS servers can be found
  netstat -plt          Return Programs Listening on TCP sockets. Note that to get all `PID` (process ID) and 
                        program names, you need to run sudo netstat
  netstat -atupn        Show All TCP and UDP listening and established connections and the program names

                        you can further filter the output by specifying the ports you are interested in, 
                        such as SMTP port 25
