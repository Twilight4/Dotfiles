################## PrivescCheck ##################
PrivescCheck -  Privilege Escalation Enumeration Script for Windows 

Usage:
. .\PrivescCheck.ps1
Invoke-PrivescCheck

Commands:
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope process -Force  
                            To run `PrivescCheck` on the target system, you may need to bypass the execution policy
                            restrictions. To achieve this, you can use the `Set-ExecutionPolicy` cmdlet

Options:

Informational:
It provides an alternative to WinPEAS without requiring the execution of a binary file.

################## WES-NG ##################
WES-NG - Windows Exploit Suggester - Next Generation
Usage:
                          To use the script, you will need to run the `systeminfo` command
                          on the target system. Do not forget to direct the output to a `.txt`
                          file you will need to move to your attacking machine. 
wes.py systeminfo.txt     Once this is done, `wes.py` can be run as follows

Commands:
wes.py --update     Once installed, and before using it, use this command to update
                    the database. The script will refer to the database it creates to
                    check for missing patches that can result in a vulnerability you 
                    can use to elevate your privileges on the target system.

Options:

Informational:
Some exploit suggesting scripts like winPEAS will require you to upload them to the target
system and run them there. This may cause antivirus software to detect and delete them. 
To avoid making unnecessary noise that can attract attention, you may prefer to use 
`WES-NG`, which will run on your attacking machine.


################## local-exploit-suggesster ##################
Metasploit:
If you already have a Meterpreter shell on the target system, you can
use the `multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester` module to list vulnerabilities
that may affect the target system and allow you to elevate your privileges
on the target system.
