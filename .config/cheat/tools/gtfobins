GTFOBins - built-in tools used as Living Off the Land techniques
Source: https://gtfobins.github.io/

If you find a misconfigured binary during your enumeration, or when you check what
binaries a user account you have access to can access, a good place to look up how
to exploit them is GTFOBins. GTFOBins is a curated list of Unix binaries that can 
be exploited by an attacker to bypass local security restrictions. It provides a 
really useful breakdown of how to exploit a misconfigured binary and is the first 
place you should look if you find one on a CTF or Pentest.
