On the internal pentest typically you're not going to be doing this,
the most maintaining access/persistence that you will do is adding
a user (net user hacker password123 /add), because it's a pentest,
not a red team assessment, being loud usually is not a problem.
You just don't have a reason to run persistence on a pentest.
