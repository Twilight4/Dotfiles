CUPP - automatic and interactive tool written in Python for creating custom wordlists
Source: https://github.com/Mebus/cupp)

Commands:
  cupp -i         Interactive mode
  cupp            Download Pre-created wordlists
  cupp -a         Provide default usernames and passwords from the Alecto database


Informational:
If you know some details about a specific target, such as their birthdate,
pet name, company name, etc., this could be a helpful tool to generate passwords
based on this known information. CUPP will take the information supplied and generate 
a custom wordlist based on what's provided. There's also support for a `1337/leet mode`,
which substitutes the letters `a`, `i`,`e`, `t`, `o`, `s`, `g`, `z`  with numbers. 
For example, replace `a` with `4`  or `i` with `1`
