What is SMB Relay:
  We can relay gathered hashes with responder to specific machines and gain access

Key flaw:
  SMB signing must be disabled or not enforced
  Relayed user credentials must be admin on machines for any real value
  SAM hashes can be used to log in to machines

Mitigation:
  Enable SMB signing on all devices
  Disable NTLM authentication on network
  Account tiering
  Local admin restriction
