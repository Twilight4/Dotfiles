What is IPv6 Attack:
  Attacker spoofs DNS server and gets authentication to the DC
  via LDAP or via SMB (he intercepts a hash). Then he can LDAP
  relay and log in and create an account.
  
Key flaw:
  If a machine is utilizing ipv4 and ipv6 is turned on, nobody is 
  doing DNS.

Mitigation:
  Disable ipv6 internally
  Disable WPAD if not used internally
  Enable LDAP signing and LDAP channel binding
