Post-Exploitation Attack Strategy: (after we compromised DC)





We own the domain, now what:
  Provide as much value to the client as possible
    Put your blinders on and do it again
    Dump the NTDS.dit and crack passwords
    Enumerate shares for sensitive information
  Persistence can be important:
    What happens if out DA access is lost?
    Creating a DA account can be useful (don't forget to delete it)
    Creating a Golden Ticket can be useful
