Post-Exploitation Attack Strategy: (after we compromised DC)
We own the domain, now what:
  Provide as much value to the client as possible:
    Pretend it didn't happen so quickly and do it again using different
    techniques (or just fuck around for the rest of the engagement).
    Dump the NTDS.dit and crack passwords.
    Enumerate shares for sensitive information.
  Persistence can be important:
    What happens if out DA access is lost?
    Creating a DA account can be useful (don't forget to delete it).
    Creating a Golden Ticket can be useful.

Recent vulnerabilities:
  Active directory vunlerabilities occur all the time.
  Recent major vulnerabilites include:
    ZeroLogon
    PrintNightmare
    Sam the Admin
  It's worth checking for these vulnerabilities, but you should not
  attempt to exploit them unless your client approves.
