Host discovery:
  <TARGET_IP>/24 	Target network range
  -sn 	          Disables port scanning
  -oA tnet 	      Stores the results in all formats starting with the name 'tnet'
  -iL             Performs defined scans against targets in provided 'hosts.txt' list
  -PE             Performs the ping scan by using 'ICMP Echo requests' against the target

Host and Port Scanning:
  -p x, -p x-y, -p-   Port scan for port <x> or scan all ports
  -Pn 	              Disable host discovery
  -n 	                Disables DNS resolution
  -sV 	              Performs a service scan

Scan Types:
  -sT                 TCP Connect Scan (default with --top-ports=1000 option - scan 1000 TCP ports)      
  -sS                 TCP-SYN "Half-Open" scan
  -sU 	              UDP scan
  -sN                 TCP Null Scan
  -sF                 TCP FIN Scan
  -sX                 TCP Xmas Scan
  -sA                 ACK Scan (method much harder to filter for firewalls and IDS/IPS systems than SYN [-sS] scan)

Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE):
  --script category   Specific Scripts Category
  -A                  Aggressive scan which includes:
  -sV                 Service scan
  -O                  OS detection
  --traceroute        Traceroute
  -sC                 Default NSE scripts

Firewall and IDS/IPS Evasion:
  -Pn               	Disable host discovery
  -n 	                Disables DNS resolution
  --disable-arp-ping  Disables ARP ping
  -sS                 Performs SYN scan on specified ports
  -D RND:5 	          Generates five random IP addresses that indicates the source IP the connection comes from
  -D DECOY1_IP1,DECOY_IP2,ME   Hide a scan with decoys
  -D RND,RND,ME       Hide a scan with random decoys
  -S SOURCE_IP	      Scans the target by using different source IP address
  -e tun0 	          Sends all requests through the specified interface
  -g 53, --source-port 53
                      Performs the scans from specified source port (DNS)
  -f                  Set the data in the IP packet to 8 bytes
  -ff                 Limit the data in the IP packet to 16 bytes
  --mtu SIZE          Provide a custom size for data carried within the IP packet
                      The size should be a multiple of 8
  --data-length NUM   Specify packet length
  --ttl VALUE         Set IP time-to-live field
  --badsum            Send packets with a wrong TCP/UDP checksum
  --ip-options        Loose routing can be specified using L. For instance:
                      --ip-options "L 10.10.10.50 10.10.50.250" requests that
                      your scan packets are routed through the two provided IP addresses.
                      Strict routing can be specified using S. Strict routing requires 
                      you to set every hop between your system and the target host. For instance:
                      --ip-options "S 10.10.10.1 10.10.20.2 10.10.30.3" specifies that the packets
                      go via these three hops before reaching the target host.
  --proxies PROXY_URL Takes a list of a comma-separated list of proxy URLs. 
                      Each URL should be expressed in the format: proto://host:port
                      Finding a reliable proxy requires some trial and error before you can rely on it to hide your Nmap scan source.
                      If you use your web browser to connect to the target, pass your trafic via proxy server.
  --spoof-mac MAC_ADDRESS   Spoof source MAC address

Additional:
  --packet-trace      Shows all packets sent and received
  --reason 	          Displays the reason a port is in a particular state
  --stats-every=5s    Defining how periods of time the status should be shown
  -v, -vv             Increases the verbosity of the scan, which displays more detailed information

Speed up your scan:
  -T5                   Aggresive scan
  --min-parallelism=50  Minimum parrallelism
  -n                    Disable reverseDNS
  --min-rate=300        Min X packets / sec
  -F                    Fast port scan (top 100 ports)

Saving the results:
  -oN output.nmap    Normal output - Save to text file
  -oG output.gnmap   Grepable output - Save to grepable file 
  -oX output.xml     XML output - Save to xml file 
  -oA output         Save in all formats
  xsltproc target.xml -o target.html
                     Convert stored results from XML format to HTML

Usefull:
  To view the scan status, we can press the [Space Bar] during the scan, which will cause Nmap to show us the scan status.
