Host discovery:
<TARGET_IP>/24 	Target network range
-sn 	          Disables port scanning
-oA tnet 	      Stores the results in all formats starting with the name 'tnet'
-iL             Performs defined scans against targets in provided 'hosts.txt' list
-PE             Performs the ping scan by using 'ICMP Echo requests' against the target

Host and Port Scanning:
-sU 	              Performs a UDP scan
-Pn 	              Disables ICMP Echo requests
-n 	                Disables DNS resolution
-sV 	              Performs a service scan

Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE):
--script category   Specific Scripts Category
-A                  Aggressive scan which includes:
-sV                 Service scan
-O                  OS detection
--traceroute        Traceroute
-sC                 Default NSE scripts

Firewall IDS/IPS Evasion:
-sA                 Performs ACK scan on specified ports (method is much harder to filter for firewalls and IDS/IPS systems than regular SYN -sS)
-Pn               	Disables ICMP Echo requests
-n 	                Disables DNS resolution
--disable-arp-ping  Disables ARP ping
-sS                 Performs SYN scan on specified ports
-D RND:5 	          Generates five random IP addresses that indicates the source IP the connection comes from
-S 10.129.2.200	    Scans the target by using different source IP address
-e tun0 	          Sends all requests through the specified interface
--source-port 53 	  Performs the scans from specified source port (DNS)

Additional:
--packet-trace      Shows all packets sent and received
--reason 	          Displays the reason a port is in a particular state

Other:
--stats-every=5s    Defining how periods of time the status should be shown
-v/-vv              Increases the verbosity of the scan, which displays more detailed information

Speed up your scan:
-T5                   Aggresive scan
--min-parallelism=50  Minimum parrallelism
-n                    Disable reverseDNS
--min-rate=300        Min X packets / sec
-F                    Fast port scan (top 100 ports)

Saving the results:
-oN [output.nmap]    Normal output - Save to text file
-oG [output.gnmap]   Grepable output - Save to grepable file 
-oX [output.xml]     XML output - Save to xml file 
-oA [output]         Save in all formats
xsltproc target.xml -o target.html
                     Convert stored results from XML format to HTML

Default settings unless we have definsed otherwise:
-sS                  TCP-SYN scan
-sT                  TCP Connect Scan
--top-ports=1000     1000 TCP ports by default

Usefull:
To view the scan status, we can press the [Space Bar] during the scan, which will cause Nmap to show us the scan status.
