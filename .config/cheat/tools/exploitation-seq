Post-Compromise Attack Strategy: (once we have an account)
  Search for quick wins:
    kerberoasting
    dumping-hashes
    pass-the-hash
  Dig deep if no quick wins:
    initial-enum (bloodhound etc.)
    where does yout account have access?
    old vulnerabilities die hard


Example Scenario of lateral/vertical movement:
  llmnr - captured hash
    cracked the hash
  pass-the-hash - sprayed the password
    found new login
  secretsdump.py - those new logins
    grabbed local admin hashes
  pass-the-hash - resprayed the network with local accounts
