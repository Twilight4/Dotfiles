# A manual approach for testing zonetransfers will be the following set of commands
# USE THE TARGET'S IP ADDRESS AS THE NAME SERVER

# Identifying nameservers
nslookup -type=NS zonetransfer.me
# or
nslookup -type=NS zonetransfer.me <IP_Address>

# Testing for ANY and AXFR Zone Transfer
nslookup -type=any -query=AXFR zonetransfer.me nsztm1.digi.ninja
# or
nslookup -type=any -query=AXFR zonetransfer.me <IP_Address>
# ZONE TRANSFERS ARE THE ONE WITH ADDRESS: 127.0.0.1
# If we manage to perform a successful zone transfer for a domain, there is no need to 
# continue enumerating this particular domain as this will extract all the available information.
