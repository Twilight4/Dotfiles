# If we want to find out whether one or more remote servers can be reached via WinRM, we can easily
# do this with the help of PowerShell. The Test-WsMan cmdlet is responsible for this, and the host's
# name in question is passed to it. In Linux-based environments, we can use the tool called evil-winrm
# another penetration testing tool designed to interact with WinRM
