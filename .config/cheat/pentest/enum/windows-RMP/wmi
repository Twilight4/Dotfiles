# Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) - port: 135
# WMI is Microsoft's implementation and also an extension of the Common Information Model (CIM), core 
# functionality of the standardized Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM) for the Windows platform.
# it is the most critical interface in the Windows environment for the administration and remote
# maintenance of Windows computers, regardless of whether they are PCs or servers.

# Footprinting the Service
# The initialization of the WMI communication always takes place on TCP port 135, and after the successful
# establishment of the connection, the communication is moved to a random port. The program wmiexec.py from the Impacket toolkit can be used for this.
