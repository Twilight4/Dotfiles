# Once we have discovered such an NFS service, we can mount it 
# on our local machine. For this, we can create a new empty folder
# to which the NFS share will be mounted. Once mounted, we can navigate 
# it and view the contents just like our local system

# Show Available NFS Shares

# Mounting NFS Share
mkdir target-NFS
sudo mount -t nfs 10.129.14.128:/ ./target-NFS/ -o nolock
cd target-NFS
tree .
# List Contents with Usernames & Group Names
ls -l mnt/nfs/
# List Contents with UIDs & GUIDs
ls -n mnt/nfs/

# Unmounting
sudo umount ./target-NFS

# We can also use NFS for further escalation. For example, if we have
# access to the system via SSH and want to read files from another folder
# that a specific user can read, we would need to upload a shell to the NFS
# share that has the SUID of that user and then run the shell via the SSH user
