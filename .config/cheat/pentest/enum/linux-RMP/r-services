# R-Services are a deprecated suite of services fore remote access in Unix OSs and now are replaced by SSH.
# Much like telnet, r-services transmit information from client to server over the network in unencrypted format.
# R-services span across the ports 512, 513, 514 and are only accessible through a suite of programs known as r-commands.
# The /etc/hosts.equiv file contains a list of trusted hosts and is used to grant access to other systems on the network. 
# When users on one of these hosts attempt to access the system, they are automatically granted access without further authentication.

# Footprinting
sudo nmap -sV -p 512,513,514 10.0.17.2

# Logging in Using Rlogin
rlogin 10.0.17.2 -l htb-student
# We have successfully logged in under the htb-student account on the remote host due to the misconfigurations in the .rhosts file

### Listing Authenticated Users Using Rwho ###
# Once successfully logged in, we can also abuse the rwho command to list all interactive sessions on the local network by sending requests to the UDP port 513
rwho
# From this information, we can see that the htb-student user is currently authenticated to the workstn01 host,
# whereas the root user is authenticated to the web01 host. We can use this when scoping out potential usernames to 
# use during further attacks on hosts over the network.
# rusers command will provide us additional information in conjunction with rwho. This will give us information such
# as the username, hostname of the accessed machine, TTY that the user is logged in to, the date and time the user logged in
# the amount of time since the user typed on the keyboard, and the remote host they logged in from (if applicable).
rusers -al 10.0.17.5
