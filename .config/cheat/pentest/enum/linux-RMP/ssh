# Fingerprinting
# ssh-audit checks the client-side and server-side configuration and shows some general information
# and which encryption algorithms are still used by the client and server
./ssh-audit.py 10.129.14.132

# The detailed output of the connection setup with the OpenSSH server can also often provide
# important information, such as which authentication methods the server can use.
# Change Authentication Method
ssh -v cry0l1t3@10.129.14.132 - example output:
debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey,password,keyboard-interactive

# For potential brute-force attacks, we can specify the authentication method with the
# SSH client option PreferredAuthentications.
ssh -v cry0l1t3@10.129.14.132 -o PreferredAuthentications=password
# with SSH-1.99-OpenSSH_3.9p1 banner, we know that we can use both protocol versions SSH-1 and SSH-2, and we are dealing with OpenSSH server version 3.9p1
# for a banner with SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.2p1, we are dealing with an OpenSSH version 8.2p1 which only accepts the SSH-2 protocol version.
