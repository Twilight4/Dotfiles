# Some of the information might turn out to be a false-positive. 
# For example as we know for a fact that the target MySQL server 
# does not use an empty password for the user root, but a fixed password. 
# We can test this with the following command:
# Log in syntax: mysql -u <user> -p<password> -h <FQDN/IP> (with password there's really no space)
mysql -u root -h 10.129.14.132

#Commands:
mysql -u <user> -p<password> -h <IP address>        # Connect to the MySQL server. There should not be a space between the '-p' flag, and the password.
