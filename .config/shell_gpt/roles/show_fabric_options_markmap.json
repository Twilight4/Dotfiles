Our plan and prediction is that people will soon be sharing many more than those we've published, and they will be way better than ours.\n\nThe wisdom of crowds for the win.\n\nCreate your own Fabric Mill\n\nfabric_mill_architecture\nBut we go beyond just providing Patterns. We provide code for you to build your very own Fabric server and personal AI infrastructure!\n\nStructure\n\nFabric is themed off of, well… fabric—as in…woven materials. So, think blankets, quilts, patterns, etc. Here's the concept and structure:\n\nComponents\n\nThe Fabric ecosystem has three primary components, all named within this textile theme.\n\nThe Mill is the (optional) server that makes Patterns available.\nPatterns are the actual granular AI use cases (prompts).\nStitches are chained together Patterns that create advanced functionality (see below).\nLooms are the client-side apps that call a specific Pattern hosted by a Mill.\nCLI-native\n\nOne of the coolest parts of the project is that it's command-line native!\n\nEach Pattern you see in the /patterns directory can be used in any AI application you use, but you can also set up your own server using the /server code and then call APIs directly!\n\nOnce you're set up, you can do things like:",
  "Take any idea from `stdin` and send it to the `/write_essay` API!": "echo \"An idea that coding is like speaking with rules.\" | write_essay\nDirectly calling Patterns\n\nOne key feature of fabric and its Markdown-based format is the ability to _ directly reference_ (and edit) individual patterns directly—on their own—without surrounding code.\n\nAs an example, here's how to call the direct location of the extract_wisdom pattern.\n\nhttps://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/blob/main/patterns/extract_wisdom/system.md\nThis means you can cleanly, and directly reference any pattern for use in a web-based AI app, your own code, or wherever!\n\nEven better, you can also have your Mill functionality directly call system and user prompts from fabric, meaning you can have your personal AI ecosystem automatically kept up to date with the latest version of your favorite Patterns.\n\nHere's what that looks like in code:\n\nhttps://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/blob/main/server/fabric_api_server.py",
